The utterance he\nfinds for this absorbing mysticism&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>in&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the products of his pen and\nbrush can best be judged by the individual observer.

The Uriah Marsh home\nlooked even gloomier than it had before. It had two windows only -\nat the front - and these were tiny.

There was a damper\non his speech.  He felt too depressed with his peregrination about\ntown to go into details about it. \"Let's go,\" he said.</p>\n<p>  Linda got up with alacrity.  A brief hunt for Mrs. Marsh located\nher in the kitchen. She loomed palely, ponderously, in the ill\u2014lit\ngloom. 'When Logan offered payment for the respite given them, she\nshook her head heavily.</p>\n<p>  \"Glad to help.\"  The rasping tone of her voice made Logan wince.\n\"Sorry you got to go so soon.

Where <span class=\"underline\">could</span> he look for her?</p>\n<p>  A full moon rode high&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>in&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the sky.  He skirted frosty patches of\nmoonlight in the yard, casting his torchlight into the shadows and\ncalling Linda\u2019s name. At the back stoop, he found his first clue -\na footprint,<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>and<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>definitely Linda's. She wore<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>only pair of high-\nheeled shoes he had seen in town.</p>\n<p>  With quickening hope, he went in t<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>h<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>e direction indicated by the\npointing toe. Another print marred the dust<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>at<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the rear gate. There\nwas a weedy alley here that abutted against&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>back of a tumbled\nout-building. He turned down its length, casting his light ahead.</p>\n<p>  Where t<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>h<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>e alley debouched&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>into&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>a street&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>of&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>windowless houses,\nthe dust was heavily tracked, many broad footprints overlaying the\nmarks Linda had left. Logan panted.</p>\n<p>  He felt cold. Something was going on here. What?  Why&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>had&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>Linda\ngone away - and with whom?  She would never&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>of&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>her free will have\nleft him alone in the middle of the night.  Yet the marks she left\nshowed where they were not overtrodden that she had walked freely,\neasily, of her own accord. Logan followed more quickly.</p>\n<p>  In the open, the croaking&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>of&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>frogs was intolerable to his ears.\nHe palmed one ear to muffle the sound, and played his light on the\nground.</p>\n<p>  Was Linda walking in her sleep?  She never had, that he knew of.\nHad she been&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>led&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>by guile?  Were <span class=\"underline\">all</span> the Marshvillians abroad to-\nnight? Their tracks were thick with and overlaying Linda's.</p>\n<p>  He came to the town's edge. He smelled<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>scent<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>of<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>pines, mingled\nwith<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>marsh smell. The ground<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>was<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>steep and rocky. Logan\u2019s breath\ncame in ragged gasps. He stumbled and dropped his light. The light\nwent out. He fumbled<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>and<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>found<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>it,<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>but it<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>no<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>longer worked.

He topped the rise\nand staggered<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>out<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>into the open moonlight. The bare hillside sloped\nbefore himto the grim mire of the swamp. The air quivered with the\nshrilling and booming of frogs.</p>\n<p>  There w<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>a<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>s shadowy movement&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>at&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the swampside.  A large crowd of\nshapes weaved<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>in<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>elusive<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>moonlight.

The Marshvillians\nwere clustered thick behind her, splashing in the cattails, shout-\ning - no, <span class=\"underline\">croaking</span> abominably as she went slowly forward, arms up-\nlifted, white skin like molten silver in the moonshine.</p>\n<p>  \"Linda!\" Logan screamed again and tore madly down the slope.</p>\n<p>  He ran, slipped, stumbled.  The mire&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>was&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>about his knees, about\nhis thighs.  Stinking mud splashed into his face.  A hand clutched\nat him, and he struck at the puffy face above with the dead flash-\nlight. The Marshvillian fell back, yammering frightfully.</p>\n<p>  Then Linda was in his arms, pale, relaxed, mired with slime, and\nthe thing Logan saw<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>he<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>could never create again in the mind of him.\nSOMETHING rose up out of the water - SOMETHING that bore vague re-\nsemblance to Uriah Marsh - SOMETHING that might have been him . . .\nor might<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>have<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>fathered him.
