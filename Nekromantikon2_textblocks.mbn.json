The utterance he\nfinds for this absorbing mysticism&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>in&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the products of his pen and\nbrush can best be judged by the individual observer.

The Uriah Marsh home\nlooked even gloomier than it had before. It had two windows only -\nat the front - and these were tiny.

There was a damper\non his speech.  He felt too depressed with his peregrination about\ntown to go into details about it. \"Let's go,\" he said.</p>\n<p>  Linda got up with alacrity.  A brief hunt for Mrs. Marsh located\nher in the kitchen. She loomed palely, ponderously, in the ill\u2014lit\ngloom. 'When Logan offered payment for the respite given them, she\nshook her head heavily.</p>\n<p>  \"Glad to help.\"  The rasping tone of her voice made Logan wince.\n\"Sorry you got to go so soon.

He struck\nat the old man but missed.  Both disappeared into the hall through\nwhich we had entered, and I rose to follow them.</p>\n<p>  H. H. stood up too, asking, \"Who are these actors?

Many of the furnish-\nings were perhaps antiquated, he thought, but they could be gradu-\nally replaced.  The grounds were delightful, ideal for his periods\nof contemplation. There were five rooms downstairs and four<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>up,<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>ex-\ncluding the bath. When he got tired of one room,<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>he<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>could move into\nanother, he told himself half-humorously.</p>\n<p>  He decided to take the fifth chamber, on<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>side facing the bay,\nas his study.

The room was thereby considerably brightened.</p>\n<p>  The bath was just across the hall, the kitchen next door.  These\nconveniences<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>had<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>been partly instrumental<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>in<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>his choice of the fifth\nchamber. But more attractive was the view it afforded. Beneath the\noverhanging branches of a heavily leafed magnolia,<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>bay appeared\nblue and charming in the distance.  Occasionally a tiny boat would\nidle past within range of his vision. Someone fishing,<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>or<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>just joy-\nriding with a sweetheart. With the window open he could hear faint\nlaughter.</p>\n<p>  Henry went to work immediately<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>on<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the treatise, working up mater-\nial he already had on the subject.

In-\nexplicably, as if sentient, it seemed to <span class=\"underline\">reject</span> his presence.  The\nhouse refused to make friends.</p>\n<p>  This, he concluded sternly, won't do.

Perhaps old Vera\nHester had wanted the house to die uninhabited. Along with her. As\nempty as she was. Although he debunked<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>supernatural in his art-\nicles, Henry actually believed&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>in&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>psychic residue to some extent.\nNot that that<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>was<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>necessarily supernatural.

Vera Hester must not have had a good\npersonality.</p>\n<p>  Finally he shrugged<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>all<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>these speculations aside<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>and<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>reasoned that\nthe basis of&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>his&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>feeling was caused solely by the physical aspect\nof<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>house. The place<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>was<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>oppressively gloomy. The living room had\nblack oaken floors, uncarpeted, and&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>walls were papered a dull\nbrown. The corners were the worst. The house had too many corners.\nThey were angled, as if deliberately, so as<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>to<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>produce deep shadows\n\u2014-even on a sunshiny day with the window curtains drawn aside.  In\nevery room except<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>bath, which<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>was<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>modern in every respect, Henry\nnoticed<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>peculiarly angled corners.

Henry planned to remedy\nthis oversight in the near future. First he wanted to complete his\ntreatise. He<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>would<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>just have<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>to<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>ignore the atmosphere.

He\nknew what he wanted to write; the facts<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>were<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>before him. Yet, every\ntime he started, the words would not come&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>out&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>in smooth sequence.\nHe would erase, re-write, scratch out, re-write again.  Henry knew\nsomething was intruding on his concentration\u2014the atmosphere of the\nhouse itself. He could not ignore it. He was to the point of feel-\ning uncomfortable\u2014even uneasy.</p>\n<p>  He left his study and walked down<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>by<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the bay.

It wafted the webs<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>of<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>gloom from<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>his<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>mind, cooled his face\nwith its soothing caress.</p>\n<p>  Out on the water a man<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>and<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>boy were fishing.

And so simple a\nthing as going to my job in the morning created a thousand hazards\nfor me.  In the times before,&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>I&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>had hardly seen Tony at the news-\nstand, for instance, or Joe at the shoe shop.  But now I bought my\npaper from&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>a&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>skeleton with a familiar voice that&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>I&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>recognized as\nTony's.

Pete's bones, for instance, seemed broad and jocular and\nfriendly. . .the chief's straight and stern.</p>\n<p>  Finally, I even brought myself to pay a visit to Mary Catherine.\nBut perhaps she had been right&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>at&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>first about&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>my&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>seeing only her\nface.

And well I knew that I\nhad never given Mary Catherine a ring.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>  I DEVOTED MYSELF TO MY CAREER.  And here let me speak a word for\nscience.  For while X-Ray vision is&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>a&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>hard thing on a man, 'tis a\nfine thing for a policeman.</p>\n<p>  Who but<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>I<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>could have seen that one-legged Jake the beggar had his\nsecond leg taped up behind him?</p>\n<p>  Or the gun swinging lightly down the street between the lipstick\nand the cigarette lighter in a woman's purse? ('Twas the woman who\nlater confessed how Carter's Department Store had been robbed.)</p>\n<p>  And who but&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>I&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>could have known that the Mexican involved in the\nopium ring had fed hundreds of hollow metal pellets to the scrawny\nchickens cooped up in the back of his car.</p>\n<p>  'Tis no wonder that<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>I<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>became famous. . .I whom Mary Catherine had\ncalled a man of superficial mind!</p>\n<p>  They raised my salary on the force and promoted me to<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>a<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>detective\n. . .assignin' me<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>to<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>special cases. In the end I had to confess the\ntruth about&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>my&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>X-Ray vision.  For how could&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>I&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>look for&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>a&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>blonde\ndressed in<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>a<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>gray flannel coat. . .when all<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>I<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>could see was a knock-</p>\n"}, "oculus_penetrans_57": {"target_line_length": 66, "content": "<p>kneed female skeleton. . .with<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>a<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>large safety pin where<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>shoulder\nstrap of her slip would be. . .and great quantities of the costume\njewelry that someone<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>had<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>been filchin' from the local five and ten,\ndrifting along against each of her hip bones.</p>\n<p>  And, of course, you know the great stir that it made when I con-\nfessed at last to my X-Ray vision.

For one day you would have seen<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>bare bones\nof one human being too many.\"</p>\n<p>  So now I have left behind&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>me&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>my fame and my chance for fortune.\nI am back with Pete&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>in&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the patrol car, though there&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>is&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>a kind of\nshadow hanging over me.  And Mary Catherine is married&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>to&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>Timothy\nRyan, which&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>is&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>just&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>as&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>well. . .for&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>her&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>bones were far from the\nprettiest that I ever saw.</p>\n<p>  And to end as I started with<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>a<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>bit of psychology, I'm happy these\ndays.  For I have met a girl with eyes of brown and hair the color\nof jet. And<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>a<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>fine figure<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>she<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>has too. . .and wit and<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>a<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>ready tongue.\nWhen I go to her house,<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>we<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>read from library books she has borrowed\nor speak of science. Already she has let<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>me<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>kiss her once. . .which\nwas when I told her how much I admired the beauty of her mind.</p>\n<p>  So I sincerely hope that&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>scientists&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>at&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>work on the problem\ncan solve the matter of ny X-Ray vision&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>to&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>her satisfaction, f<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>o<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>r\nI know that it worries her. Or I wish that the old woman who's the\nspittin' image&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>of&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>my grandmother will turn&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>up&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>again and grant me\none more wish.</p>\n<p>  But do you know,&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>I&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>sometimes wonder&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>if&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the REAL secret project\nthat the FBI had&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>me&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>workin'&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>on&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>was&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>to&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>help them locate&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>the&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>old\nwoman.  For sure the government would want a monopoly of the power\nto grant wishes, wouldn't they?</p>\n<p>  And do you know, that&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>if&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>so, and they try&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>to&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>force her (though\nI am an admirer of science) somehow&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>I&nbsp;<span class=\"thin\">&nbsp;</span>believe that she meant what\nshe said.  She will make anyone who tries to monopolize magic wish\nthey were dead. And then she won't grant the wish.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>                              THE END</p>\n"}, "david_h_keller_md_59": {"target_line_length": 66, "content": "<p>People are his mind's own secret toys.\nHe can heal frail, injured flesh,\nbut keen fingers of his thought lance sharp\ninto private souls.
