  For weeks we have been up to the elbows in a fuming vat of nitric
acid, painfully learning by experience the devious and arcane art
of the photo engraver.  We have inhaled hydrogen enough to inflate
the lamented Graf Zeppelin, nitric acid vapor in quantities that
would scald the rust from the boilers of the Queen Mary. These are,
by the way, vaporous by-products of the engraving process. The mod-
erate success of our efforts is to be seen and analyzed on the cover
and in the following pages.

  We work under disadvantages, after all. We made engravings at the
kitchen sink, but it is not the best place for it, you can believe
us.  No more shall be made until a proper "plant" has been consti-
tuted for it in the basement, with adequate ventilation.

  Many thanks to you readers for your kind letters and helpful sug-
gestions. We feel that an improvement has been effected in the for-
mat of the magazine. Some of you complained of the lack of sturdi-
ness of the cover, and this has been, we think, adequately remedied.
We have worked over and modernized our bookbinder's "plow and press"
to simulate mass production in the trimming of magazine edges.  We
have given thought to our choice of paper for this issue and have
laid in a number of fonts of interesting type  to  dress up story
heads and type pages.

  We hope to continue improving the magazine, even if it should pre-
vent the meeting of publication deadlines.  We are in this for fun
and, thank Heaven, punch no time clock and waste no rue upon throw-
ing profits after losses.

  You who have seen our Spring issue will note that this Summer num-
ber is six pages longer.  This signifies nothing.  The Fall number
may be longer, or it may be shorter.  We maintain an attitude of
cheerful irresponsibility in respect to how many pages shall con-
stitute an issue; though we avow that  our readers shall not get
less than their two bits' worth. . .wholesale.

  We are very well taken with the possibilities of color in the field
of photo engraving.  We have not the facilities (nor do we intend
to acquire any) for the production of screen half-tone plates. Line
plates offer a fascinating enough field for interesting experimen-
tation. Our cover and Ul-Ul on the back cover demonstrate the basic
fundamentals of such color work.  (Ul-Ul is printed from one zinco
and two lino blocks.) Complex variations with the use of solid and
Ben Day tints are full of possibilities. Look for something of this
nature in the Fall issue.

  We feel that our writers this issue have done themselves proud.
We are highly pleased with the quarter's achievement in this dir-
ection.  A small matter of technique is all that stands between
most amateur writers and their goal of professional standing.  If
your basic thinking is sound, you can hammer at technique until you
get it down right.  Knowing what to say is at least three quarters
of the battle. How to say it comes with practice. We would not coun-
sel any who hoped to write to give up that hope.  You can always
write, if not to sell, at least for your satisfaction.

  Let us see more of your scripts.

                     RALPH RAYBURN PHILLIPS
                       Ultra Weird Artist


  New indeed is the fan who has not before this made acquaintance
with the work of Ralph Rayburn Phillips, whose generous zeal in
the interest of the weird and macabre is portrayed in these pages.

  Hailing from the green hills of New England, Ralph now shares a
grave with another corpse in a prominent Portland, Oregon cemetery.
As shadows of night close subtly down and the last spark of a bloody
sun is extinguished in the purpling sky, the earth crumbles, and a
horrid figure dredges its way out of what should be its resting
place serene. Ralph Rayburn Phillips! The world's weirdest and most
macabre artist! You recognize him by the clay-smeared drawing board
under his arm. . .and those long, long fingernails he uses to draw
with (all five at once, and sometimes ten), after dipping them in
the blood of his latest victim!  (Our film is orthochromatic, any-
way, and red photographs black).

  Seriously, Ralph is one of the most original artists in this field
we have seen.  Unlike Dali who mutilates normalcy to achieve his
desired effect, Ralph departs entirely from normalcy to the extent
that you either like his work immensely, or you like it not at all.
We happen to like it.

  Actually, Ralph does do his work at night, when the owl hoots
outside his window, and the bat makes like a flying saucer against
the moon.   When you view his work, you can hear the creak of the
coffin lid, the clangor of lugubrious chains, the moan and wail of
the spirit condemned.

  Like a living alter-ego of Lovecraft, Ralph Rayburn Phillips brings
to life the inventions and imaginings of that master of the weird
and fantastic.  Indeed, Ralph feels that between himself and Love-
craft in his grave there exists an intangible bond, a sharing, as
it were, of the ghostly knowledge of worlds beyond worlds, of uni-
verses beyond ken.

  If there are, indeed, works of pictorial art that will reveal
that dimension from which Lovecraft drew his imagery and inspiration,
then these are the work of Ralph Rayburn Phillips.

  Other fields besides art grapple with Ralph for his time. He is,
for instance, the founder and head of the American Buddhist Soc-
iety and spends much time in the meditation of profound and esoteric
things. He is a mystic, with a mystic personality. The utterance he
finds for this absorbing mysticism in the products of his pen and
brush can best be judged by the individual observer. If you do not
see it there, if you do not read into the boldness and obscure
symbolism of  his work the soul of  a true mystic absorbed in a
contemplation of the infinite, then you have no part of the mystic
in you.

  Most cogent of all, perhaps. . .Ralph is a fan among fans, a sin-
cere devotee to fandom.  He is a member of the Portland Science
Fiction Society of Portland, Oregon, and an earnest friend of every
serious fan.  Try to make it to the Norwescon this September 1—-4,
and you will doubtless get a chance to meet him.

  A SHRILL, MULTITUDINOUS PIPING OF FROGS found voice suddenly at
high noon in August, in downtown LeFarge.

  John Logan stopped with one foot outside the LeFarge National
Bank and received a smart rap on the heel of the other from the re-
volving door. A perspiring patron catapulted from the exit, caromed
off Logan's left arm, scowled over his shoulder,  and hurried off
into the swirl of the midday throng.

  The froggy litany shrilled to a crescendo. Logan mentally thumbed
his brain-index of sounds.  Frogs.  Only frogs.  He shrugged  and
grinned to himself.

  Frogs? Downtown. . .in mid-August?

  He followed with his ear, then his eyes, the course of the sound
—-now a vibrant noise, loud and painfully throbbing; though appar-
ently it was unheard or ignored by the hurrying crowd, for none
save he paused to listen.

  An enormous fat man sat behind the wheel of a disreputable black
sedan parked at the curb. Half the wheel was hidden in his enormous
paunch. Coarse, hand-sewn clothes gaped at the seams in a Gargantuan

== fen_wer_6 66 ==

task to encompass such a mountain of flesh.  From swollen, doughy
hillocks of gray-green flesh, black eyes pierced keenly toward Lo-
gan, as if their monstrous owner was aware of Logan’s interest.

  The two locked glances. The fat man turned his head, made a pon-
derous movement.  The chuckling of frogs merged with  the sound of
the revving motor. The sedan moved out from the curb.

  John Logan shook himself and grinned sheepishly. For a moment, he
had imagined the froggish din was coming straight from the fat man's
paunch—-when more likely it was the protest of main bearings in need
of oil.

  He swung off down the street and promptly forgot the fat man and
the idling motor that had seemed to sound like a swamp full of frogs.

  Linda Logan-—brunette, dainty, "pretty as peaches" in the par-
lance of husband John—-had finished packing their bags by the time
John got back from the bank.

  "Hullo, Yawn, dear." She slithered into his arms.

  "I won't yawn," said John. He kissed her ear, then planted a firm
buss on her healthy, pouting lips.

  Linda laughed, tossed her long hair, pulled back in the circling
embrace of his arms.

  "Woe is me - the honeymoon is over!"

  "Not this one," John denied. "It's just starting, baby, and it's
going to last fifty years!"

  Linda pouted. "A week ago, you'd have. . ."

  Logan pushed her away. "Shut up. Are the bags packed?"

  "Yep - for the last time.  Tomorrow we'll be home.  Home!"  She
looked starry-eyed and soulful.

  "Home!"  echoed John.  "Home - where you walk up two flights and
back in through the door, so you'll be facing the right way when
you come out in the morning! Nope. We're not going home, Linda-sweet."

  She looked a question. John fumbled in his pocket, brought out a
crumpled, yellow telegram.

  "From Grant - feature editor, in case I neglected to mention him
before."

  Linda wrinkled her nose thoughtfully. "Mmmm....Aloysius G. Grant
of the Never-Grant-Anything Grants. Gimme."

  She smoothed out the paper.

  PLAGUE OF FROGS AT YAGGERS LANDING WHERE IN GOD'S NAME IS THAT
LOOK IT UP GRANT.

  Linda fluttered the message. "Did you, Yawn?"

  "I didn't yawn, and if you don't quit using that infernal sobri-
quet, I'll —-"

  "Ah, ah, dear! Never make idle threats to your wife!"

  John grabbed her, sprawled her across a lifted knee, and raised
a threatening hand.

  "I'll 'idle threat' you, you witch!"

  Struggling, Linda turned a stricken face.

  "I won't ever again, honest. Lemme go. Where's Yagger's Landing?"

  John lifted her to her feet, dusted his hands. They both laughed,
and he kissed her.

  "That's better. Thirty-two miles from here.  That-a-way." Sweep-

== fen_wer_7 66 ==

ingly his gesture included the countryside generally from north to
south in a westerly approximation. "Let’s get out of here."


  THE FOOTHILLS BEGAN almost on the outskirts of LeFarge. Logan
tooled the sleek little convertible around dizzying, hair-pin turns.
The motor labored from the climb.  Sunlight glinted on the white
safety-rail hugging the edge of smooth macadam. An occasional turn
brought glimmering peaks into distant view, pine-skirted, capped in
glistening white, hewn in bold relief against the clean, blue back-
drop of sky.

  "The glories'of Nature," breathed Linda, "where the hand of man
has never trod!"

  John ignored her flippancy.

  "As far as I could find out," he said, "Yagger's landing isn't
much of a place.  I phoned the hotel there.  The clerk didn't even
know why it was called 'Landing.' There isn't a river for miles. It
has a population  of  two hundred - the town, not the river. It's
some kind of resort, I gathered, though the frogs have played hob
with business this season. Noisy, the clerk says. People don't stay
long."

  "I thought you always heard frogs in the country at night," re-
marked Linda. "I always did - I think."

  "I also telephoned Grant," Logan continued. "Some friends of his
vacationed - tried to - at Yagger's Landing.  They left after the
first night. Frogs kept 'em awake. Peculiar, too. Yagger's Landing
is dry ground.  The marsh is at the headwaters of the river I men-
tioned - fifteen miles above the town. Grant wants me to interview
the frogs and find out why they've migrated over fifteen miles of
dry land to make life miserable for tourists at Yagger's Landing.
Maybe, he says, there's a story in it. Maybe, he says, the frogs
are tired of being cooped up in marshes and are marshalling - ha,
ha, that's a good one! (quoting Grant) to descend upon civilization.
Make the most out of it, he says, if you have to write the story
around a recipe for fried frog legs.

  "You talk," said Linda, "like a feature writer. All choppy, but
to the point."

  "I don't waste words," John retorted.

  "Did you ever waste time, dear?" cooed Linda sweetly.

  Logan ignored the pointed inference to their errand.

  "Not till I met you." He leaned over and kissed her swiftly.

  "Hey, watch out! Keep your eyes on the road!"

  "Last time I did that, a truck ran over 'em, and I've been pop-
eyed ever since!"

  He screeched the convertible around a turn.


  TO SAY THAT YAGGER'S LANDING was not much aggrandized it.  Yag-
ger's Landing wasn't anything. The clerk who had claimed the popu-
lation as two hundred had lied in his teeth. Linda and John did not
see two hundred blow flies as they rolled up the dusty main street.

  "Good Lord!" said Linda.

  Logan agreed with her.  The town was barren.  Houses and stores

== fen_wer_8 66 ==

looked deserted. There wasn’t even a loafer in sight. The sun dwelt
in a liquefied golden haze upon a silent tomb deserted even by its
corpse.

  John found a parking lot beside the teetering, rangy structure
of weathered clapboard that called itself a hotel, and turned off
the ignition. The shimmering engine plunked gratefully, gurgled and
grated into a kind of breathless quiet that matched the bright pall
of silence over the village.

  The inside of the hotel was no more prepossessing than the out-
side. A bit cooler, perhaps, and darker.

  On their way to the desk, John almost fell over the outstretched
legs of a man buried in a Morris chair. He sidestepped nimbly just
in time, adjusting his vision to the gloom.  The ponderous bulk in
the chair looked familiar. The keenly penetrating eyes were blanked
out now in folds of somnolent fat. The mountainous man snored thinly,
with a sound as of a multitude of frogs yodelling an infinite dis-
tance away.

  "Yes, sir. Yes sir!. You're the man who telephoned!"

  Linda looked askance at the weedy, middle-aged clerk, who held
her with his bright-eyed glance, and pointed at John.

  "No, he is."

  "Of course. Of course! Welcome to Yagger's Landing, sir! You, too,
ma'm.  I know you'll like it here at Yagger's Landing. Fine place.
Except for the frogs, like I told Mr. - uh - Nolan - uh - Logan.
Really, we don't mention the frogs  to prospective guests, but you
asked. . ."

  "Yes, I asked," said Logan. "Who's your fat friend?"

  The clerk grimaced, lowered his voice.

  "He don't belong here - not at Yagger's Landing. Disgusting, ain't
he? Whole tribe like him live up in the swamp country. Didn't used
none of 'em much to come down this way, but he's been here pretty
regular all summer. Does nothin' but loaf - goes home nights, though,
thank Goodness'." He made a motion of dusting with his hands.

  Logan felt a prickle of interest. "Town up there?"

  "Marshville.  Not named for the swamp, though.  Everybody in the
place is named Marsh.  A regular tribe of Marshes. They - yes, sir
. . .here's your key. Like I was saying, the room is nice and airy,
and you can see the mountains from the window. ..."

  Logan was aware that the distant tittering of frogs had ceased.
He turned.  The fat man was staring at them with a certain malig-
nancy evident in his black-eyed gaze.  Only for an instant Logan
clashed glances with the man, then the puffy lids merged and the
fat man became again a somnolent mountain of flesh.


  "AN UTTERLY GRUESOME HOLE," Linda muttered succintly. Their room
was barren as the town of Yagger's Landing itself, though moderately
clean.

  "This room," queried Logan.

  "A hole within a hole. Horrible!" Linda sniffed.  "Who said this
is a resort?"

  "The clerk.  People come up here for a few days in summer.  Go

== fen_wer_9 32 ==

tramping over the mountain trails.
Excellent sport, and so good for
one."

  "Well, where are the frogs?
I haven’t heard a chirp since
we’ve been here."

  Logan pursed his lips for a re-
ply, relaxed.  He could hear the
frogs ululating a long distance
away.

  "Listen close," he advised.

  Linda listened, twisting  her
pretty face into a frown of con-
centration.

  "Nary a frog, dear. Why listen?"

  Logan cocked his head.  "No...
can't hear a thing myself...now.
Thought I did. It's daytime, any-
way-or will be for another thirty
minutes."

  He went to the open window. Limp
curtains hung listlessly in the
still air. To westward, the moun-
tains rose gold-capped, skirted
in deep mauve and purple.  Linda
found the circle of his arm and
sighed.

  "Lovely, isn't it? It's like -
like - oh, nobody ever wrote a
poem that's like that."

  John cuddled her. "That's what
I love about you, darling.  You
appreciate things."

  Together they watched the gol-
den sun sink to meet the mountains.
Purple shadows swirled up from
slumbering valleys, danced  into
the sky to stain the blue and etch
out the stars. Twilight was brief
- then the frogs began.

  Linda slammed the window. "What
a climax!" she cried in hurt rage.

  From near and far, and seem-
ingly from within their very room,
the frogs boomed, bellowed, twit-
tered, chirped, and belled.  The
night was alive with frogs,  and
the air quivered with their noise.
The very walls shook with a hor-
rible cacophony of froggish
throats shouting in tympany glee.

== fen_wer_10 66 ==

  Linda stopped her ears against the din. "Are we supposed to sleep
through this, or do they let up after a while?"

  "As I understand it," Logan winced, "they keep it up all night
long.  That's our story - remember?  Translate that, and it means
bread and butter. Which reminds me, I'm hungry. Do they feed people
in this vile place?"

  As if on cue, a tapping came at the door.  Logan opened up.  The
clerk looked sheepinsh and miserable.

  "I'm sorry about the frogs, folks. Didn't used to be any at all in
these parts.  Terrible now-a-days -- druv the whole population out
of town except me. They . . ."

  "Is there a place around here we can eat?" Logan put in brusquely.

  "That’s what I come up here to tell you.  Dinner is ready in the
Coffee Shop. You two are the only guests. I fixed your supper spec-
ial myself."

  "I guess your fat friend is gone," said Logan.

  "Don't say that! He's no friend of mine! He's - he left when the
frogs began to holler. Don't like 'em no more'n you or me, I guess."
He turned to Linda. "I'm sorry the vittles ain't better'n they are,
ma'm.  Our cook left two weeks ago.  No guest stays here longer'n,
mebbe, a night, so I get along cookin' for 'em myself."

  They ate a drab supper with the drab little man for company. . .
and the booming of the frogs. Logan found that if you concentrated
on the food, the noise seemed to diminish a little--maybe. But the
food was as bad to one sense as the noise to the other, so it wasn't
worth the effort.

  "My ears hurt," said Linda.

  "I think I'm a little deaf to the high notes," opined the clerk.

  "And the low notes don't bother me. I used to be a drummer in an
orchestra."

  Logan abandoned their cheerless repast and took Linda back up to
their room.

  "Tomorrow," he said, "we're going up to Marshville and look in on
the Marshes as well as the marsh, find a frog willing to be inter-
viewed - or failing that, a Marsh will do - and get home by tomorrow
night. Damn Grant and his frogs. Thank heaven I don't have to write
the thing here!"


  IN SPITE OF THE CLERK'S ALMOST TEARFUL PROTEST, John and Linda
drove off toward Marshville in the morning.

  "You don't want to go there!" he mourned. "All them horrible, ugly
folks. . . They — they do things—-" He put a hand over his eyes.

  "What things?" asked Logan.

  "Not Christian - you know? I- I don't know. There used to be peo-
ple in Yagger's Landing. . .before the frogs came. They. . .talked.
Said things, you understand.  Just gossip.  I only went to Marsh-
ville once.  Got the horrors and came right back.  It's not a. . .
good place."

  Marshville was an evil place.  Its main street ended in the mire
of a swamp, scummed and nauseous looking, mud-flats and stagnant
pools forested with giant cattails nodding brown, fuzzy cylinders

== fen_wer_11 66 ==

above the reeds and lesser marsh grasses. Logan turned the convert-
ible, drove back along the muddy street.

  There was an air of slothful activity about the place that had
been entirely lacking at Yagger's Landing, though houses and one-
story buildings were equally run-down.  Logan noted with interest
that the houses were almost windowless, silent in the hot breezes
of the August morning.

  A weary tree grew in the town square.  A few corpulent citizens
lolled in its shade, or sunned themselves speechlessly on the grass.
Logan spied a dirty window with the legend:  MARSHVILLE. U.S. POST
OFFICE. He left Linda in the car with a word of admonition and went
inside.

  The place appeared to be disused.  The floor was inch-deep with
dried mud.  More mud smeared the walls and the fly-specked glass
fronts of the mail boxes. Logan went to the only window and peered
into the darkness beyond.  Something stirred with a soft scraping
sound in the gloom of the back room.  Short hairs prickled on the
back of Logan's neck. A formless blob of deathly white wavered in-
to the semi-dark of the front, resolved itself into one of the
corpulent citizens of Marshville.

  He peered at Logan over puffed, greenish-white cheeks.

  "Nobody ever comes here," he rasped warningly.

  The cold scrutiny of the Marshvillian gave Logan a feeling of
annoyance.

  "I'm here," he said brusquely. "I’m looking for a hotel.  Didn’t
see any sign—-"

  "No hotel," croaked the misshapen postmaster. "Nobody ever comes
here, I say’. Why should there be a hotel?"

  "I don't want to live here - or even stay over night." Logan was
impatient.  "I just want a place where my wife and I can clean up
and get a bite to eat. We're just passing through."

  The postmaster knew he lied.  Marshville was at a dead end.  You
didn't "just pass through."

  "Nobody—-" he began ponderously, then clamped his thick lips at
a croaking whisper from the dark at his back.  He shuffled from the
window and was merged with the shadows. There was a faint plopping
and clucking noise.

  Logan fretted and bit his lip. Should he walk out, or had he got
the impression that the postmaster would return? While he debated,
the postmaster dragged into view.

  "Missus Uriah Marsh," he said stolidly. "She will take you in."

  "A hotel?" said Logan.

  "No hotel, I said. Missus Marsh - Uriah Marsh - will take you in."

  He grunted directions and Logan went out.  At the threshold, he
cast a glance over his shoulder.  A pale, blobby roundness at the
postmaster's window was snatched suddenly from sight - but not sud-
denly enough to prevent Logan's recognizing the face of the fat man
he had seen in LeFarge and at Tagger's landing. Unaccountably, a
chill went through him.

  Outside, the rank swamp air smelled clean and tasted sweet after
his sojourn in that morgue of a post office.

== fen_wer_12 66 ==

  "I've found a place where we can clean up and get something to
eat, honey," he told Linda. "You can stay there and rest this after-
noon, while I look the town over. Then we'll get out of here."

  Linda offered nothing to say. She was unusually sober and quiet.
Her normally glowing charm struggled without effect against the
dismal atmosphere of the village. In spite of the bright sun, a
shadow as dark as the mephitic odor of the swamp seemed tb hover
over the town.


  MRS. URIAH MARSH HAD NO DISCERNIBLE AGE. Like all Marshvillians,
she was bursting the seams of her coarse, hand-made clothing.  Her
demeanor was bland. She spoke hoarsely.

  "Come in. It ain't often we have visitors in Marshville."

  "The man at the post office—" Logan began.

  Mrs. Marsh waved a fat hand.

  "I've had word, Mr. Logan. Come right in."

  Logan jumped.  He thought-—the fat man.  The hotel register at
Yagger's Landing. The fat man had shown undue interest to read his
name. . .and remember it.  Who. . .or what. . .was the fat man in
Marshville?  Certainly, he had instructed the postmaster to send
them here.

  Logan said, "Is Uriah a fat man - fatter than most in Marshville?"

  Mrs. Marsh nodded elephantine agreement. "He's my husband and our
mayor—-so far as we've got one.  But don't stand there-—come in.
I've got stuff fixed for you to eat."

  They ate and the food was surprisingly good. Afterward, Mrs. Marsh,
ponderously affable, showed them to a room where they could "freshen
up."  It was cool, and there wan an oil lamp burning on a stand by
the bed. The room was windowless.

  "No windows!" Exclaimed Linda.

  "Windows ain't much the fashion in Marshville," Mrs. Marsh ex-
plained. She hesitated.  "Glass is mighty expensive and breaks too
easy,"

  She turned and waddled away, leaving them alone.

  "Keeps out the smell of the swamp, at least," Logan observed. He
squeezed Linda's arm affectionately. "You lie down and rest a bit,
honey. I'll see what I can dig up around town, take a few pictures,
and we'll be on our way."

  Linda clung to him. Her voice sounded frightened and breathless. 

  "John! Don't go away and leave me here alone. I-I'm scared!"

  Logan attempted a laugh, but the resulting noise was hollow.  He
stroked Linda's dark hair and held her cheek against his chest. 

  "Darling!  This isn't like you.  After a frog-ridden night, you
need rest. Just take it easy an hour or two—"

  Linda's fingers dug into his ribs.

  "Listen!"

  Somewhere in the house, something dragged and bumped.  The sound
repeated itself a time or two, then the house grew still.

  "Just the old lady moving a sack of flour," Logan said carelessly.
"Don't get nervy now, darling.  I'll get my camera out of the car
and stroll around a little, and be back before you know it."

== fen_wer_13 66 ==

  He led her unprotesting to the bed, saw that she was comfortable,
and left the room.

  In a way, Logan didn't blame the girl. The atmosphere of the whole
town was one of brooding, abysmal depression. And to be led,  in
broad day, into a gloomy, windowless chamber lighted only by an oil-
lamp was something on the shocking side. He hoped she would rest.

  The town square seethed sluggishly.  Double doors stood open at
the front of a windowless building opposite the post office. A crowd
of natives shuffled about the entrance, some passing inside, others
standing and greeting their neighbors.

  Logan held up his press camera and made an exposure that took in
the entire facade of the building. He hoped he could capture some-
thing of the air of sodden gloominess that infested the place.  He
went closer and made a few close-ups of the stolidly shuffling
citizens.  No one seemed to mind or pay him more attention than a
curious glance or two.

  Logan wondered what was going on.  Was this a town meeting—-or a
religious group gathering to "do" things?  Swinging his camera by
its strap, he joined the entering stream.

== fen_wer_14 66 ==

  A hand seized Logan's shoulder, pulled him out of the line. Logan
convulsed with a hot spasm of rage.

  "Why, you—-!"

  The Marshvillian regarded him with blank, puffed features.

  "Sorry. Strangers ain't wanted in here."

  "Listen," Logan said through set teeth. "I'm a reporter, see? I'll
go where I please. Now—-"

  The last of the citizenry had passed inside.  Stolidly, compla-
cently, the fat native placed a hand against Logan's chest and
pushed.

  Logan picked himself up from the dust and hardened mud of the
street, wrathful and choking; but the double doors were ominously
closed.

  There was no contesting the blank disinterest of that facade. An
aura of cold malignancy struck chill to Logan’s wrath. A reporter
gets used, he told himself, to being told no, in one form or another.

  "At least," he thought, "they don't object to my taking pictures."

  He raised his camera and spitefully photographed the post office.
Practically the entire population seemed to be attending the meet-
ing in the windowless hall. In his stroll he met an occasional old-
ster or a woman shuffling along, but never once did he see a child.
He began to wonder about this.

  His attempts to question the occasional villager he met proved
fruitless. They simply croaked and shambled on. He wandered to the
verge of the stinking swamp, photographed the giant cattails, and
never saw a single frog.

  At last he gave up and went back for Linda. The Uriah Marsh home
looked even gloomier than it had before. It had two windows only -
at the front - and these were tiny. He wondered about Mrs. Marsh's
explanation of the lack of windows. There was plenty to wonder about
in this macabre town. Even if he had found out nothing about frogs,
he already had the makings of a whale of a feature article -— with
pictures. Maybe he could weave frogs into it somehow.

  He went in. Linda was sleeping.  In spite of his care, he made
noise walking on the bare floor. Linda woke with a start, eyes wide.
Recognition flooded her glance, and she smiled tiredly.

  "I did sleep after all, dear."

  "It did you good, too," he told her jocularly. There was a damper
on his speech.  He felt too depressed with his peregrination about
town to go into details about it. "Let's go," he said.

  Linda got up with alacrity.  A brief hunt for Mrs. Marsh located
her in the kitchen. She loomed palely, ponderously, in the ill—lit
gloom. 'When Logan offered payment for the respite given them, she
shook her head heavily.

  "Glad to help."  The rasping tone of her voice made Logan wince.
"Sorry you got to go so soon. Sure you'll come back won't you?"

  The parting was an ordeal, but they made it finally to the car.
Logan put his camera away behind the seat, settled back with a
gratified sigh, and stepped on the starter.  The motor turned over
without responding. After ten minutes of cursing and prodding under
the hood, Logan gave up in exasperation.

== fen_wer_15 66 ==

  "Go ask Mrs. Marsh," he told Linda, "if there is a garage man in
town."

  Linda went and came back with Mrs. Marsh waddling behind her. 

  "Well, now, that’s a shame, Mr. Logan. There’s no regular garage
man-—only Luke, a sort of cousin of mine, who does know something
about cars. It'll take a little time, but I'll go fetch him for you."

  She shuffled away behind the house.

  Linda regarded her husband with large,  frightened eyes, in the
dark depths of which a certain horror swam.

  "She - she acted like she was expecting me to come back. Oh can't
we do something to get out of this horrible place? It - it frightens
me!"

  Logan shrugged gloomily.  "Not unless we get the car started,
dear. Luke will find out what's wrong." His words lacked conviction.

  The wait seemed endless.  It was fully half an hour before Mrs.
Marsh came back, towing her "sort of cousin" Luke. Luke was puffed
and bloated like every other Marshvillian Logan had seen.

  The native puttered under the hood, came up with a bit of some-
thing clamped between fat fingers .

  "Burned out," he observed laconically.

  Logan was irritated, "Can you fix it?"

  "Need a new one."

  "Get one and put it in."

  Luke became placidly stolid.

  "You can get one in LeFarge."

  Logan exploded. "LeFarge? That's fifty miles awayI"

  "Forty-seven, " corrected Luke.

  "How in the name of - of ...how am I going to get a part like that
from LeFarge?"

  Luke glanced at Mrs. Marsh.

  Mrs. Marsh said, "Luke, you go down to the post office and tele-
phone somebody in LeFarge to send up a part like that for Mr. Logan.
It can come in tomorrow's mail."  She turned to John and Linda.
"The only telephone in town is at the post office."

  Logan didn't care.  "Never mind," he said quickly. "We'll go to
LeFarge ourselves and send somebody back with the part to pick up
the car."

  Mrs. Marsh looked at him queerly.

  "I don't see how you can do that. There's no way to get to LeFarge
except to walk. Or wait for tomorrow's mail truck."

  Logan's nerves tingled. "Somebody must have a car and will drive us!"

  Mrs. Marsh shook her head.  "Shame. My husband owns the only car
in town. He's gone. . .visitin'. Won't be back until tomorrow." She
smiled benignly at Linda.  "You might as well have Luke telephone,
Mr. Logan."

  The resistance went out of Logan. He put a dollar in Luke's hand,
and the native shambled off.

  "Now you come right in and make yourselves to home,"  Mrs. Marsh
urged them. "You'll be comfortable here tonight, and tomorrow's as
good as today for what you have to do, I always say." She smiled at
Linda, and somehow Logan's stomach felt sickish.

== fen_wer_16 66 ==

  He looked at Linda and read the defeat in her eyes. They got out
their bags and went into the house with Mrs. Marsh.

  "As long," Logan said gloomily, "as we're going to have to stay
here, I might as well develop my film tonight and check those shots."
Linda had a headache. She lay on the bed and rested, while Logan
got bottled chemicals and the film holders from the car. A little
later, when he had lighted the lamp again, Logan held up the films
one by one and swore. It was all clear celluloid - not the ghost
of an image.

  Logan got out his camera and checked. The curtain shutter was
tied open, as he kept it. The front shutter functioned perfectly.
He distinctly remembered removing the dark slides. In the dim glow
of the lamp, Linda's eyes were large and dark.

  "If you took pictures, there should be pictures on the film,
shouldn't there?"

  "There should," Logan agreed dispiritedly. "Something went wrong somewhere."

  Linda whimpered. "John! John -let's leave - on foot if we have to."

  He put his arm around her. "Linda, darling! It's fifteen miles
through the wildest kind of country back to Yagger's Landing, even!
We'd be no better off there than here."

  Linda appeared genuinely frightened.

  "John - there's evil in this place - awful, horrible evil! I can
feel it through and through me! Silver rejects evil, John. Silver
is a charm against bad things. The silver in your film - oh, John!"

  Logan held her close and tried to soothe her frightened sobbing.
Abruptly, she held her breath, listening. Something dragged in an-
other part of the house. It bumped, like a thing soft and heavy
dropped froma height. The curious sound was repeated several times.

  "John, Mrs. Marsh wouldn't spend the whole afternoon moving - or
thumping - a sack of flour around, would she?"

  They listened while the sound continued. Finally it stopped. Logan
stroked Linda's hair.

  "You worry too much about nothing, dear. Lie back and try to rest."
  He laid her gently back upon the pillow. Linda closed her eyes.
Her face was drawn and pale, waxen in the dim shine of the lamp.
Soon the sound of her even breathing told him that she slept.

  Logan went out to the car, glared at it futilely, and fished in
the trunk for a few essentials. Time had passed swiftly. It was
nearly sunset. Mrs. Marsh met him at the door with an invitation to
supper."

  "I don't believe I'd care for anything, thanks," he told her. "My
wife is sleeping, and I'd rather not disturb her. I think perhaps
she'll sleep the night through."

  Linda did sleep, even after the croaking of the frogs began with
the sunset. Somehow the noise seemed more bearable here than at
Yagger's Landing. The windowless walls muffled the sound. Logan felt
an overpowering weariness. He lay down beside Linda, not bothering
to undress, and slept.

  Hours later, Logan aroused. He reached to touch Linda. The room
was pitch dark. The lamp had used up its oil, or somebody had come

== fen_wer_17 66 ==

in and blown out the flame. His groping hand felt only the coarse
weave of the coverlet.

  Dazed, he whispered her name.

  "Linda!" The syllables slithered like a nameless serpent in the
dark. He applied flame to the wick. Linda was not in the room. Con-
fused with sleep, he took out his watch, but he had forgotten to
wind it, and it was useless to tell the time. He went to the door
and called Linda.

  The house echoed with a creeping, repulsive silence Away from
the feeble, yellow glow of the lamp, the shadows seemed like mon-
sters crouched to spring. He recoiled, took up the lamp with a
feeling of mounting alarm.

  "Linda!" His voice cracked hoarsely on the final syllable.

  The booming of the frogs mocked him. The noise they made pounded
against his skull, breaking the tenuous threads of thought in his
mind. He carried the lamp from room to room and found no one. Leav-
ing it on a stand in the hall, he went out to the car and got a
flashlight. Its cold, white cone of illumination offered some meas-
ure of comfort.

  Where should he look next? The house was empty. Were was Linda?
Where was Mrs. Marsh? Had Linda gone some place with the Marshvill-
ian? It was absurd to suppose so. Where could he look for her?

  A full moon rode high in the sky. He skirted frosty patches of
moonlight in the yard, casting his torchlight into the shadows and
calling Linda’s name. At the back stoop, he found his first clue -
a footprint, and definitely Linda's. She wore the only pair of high-
heeled shoes he had seen in town.

  With quickening hope, he went in the direction indicated by the
pointing toe. Another print marred the dust at the rear gate. There
was a weedy alley here that abutted against the back of a tumbled
out-building. He turned down its length, casting his light ahead.

  Where the alley debouched into a street cf windowless houses,
the dust was heavily tracked, many broad footprints overlaying the
marks Linda had left. Logan panted.

  He felt cold. Something was going on here. What? Why had Linda
gone away - and with whom? She would never of her free will have
left him alone in the middle of the night. Yet the marks she left
showed where they were not overtrodden that she had walked freely,
easily, of her own accord. Logan followed more quickly.

  In the open, the croaking of frogs was intolerable to his ears.
He palmed one ear to muffle the sound, and played his light on the
ground.

  Was Linda walking in her sleep? She never had, that he knew of.
Had she been led by guile? Were all the Marshvillians abroad to-
night? Their tracks were thick with and overlaying Linda's.

  He came to the town's edge. He smelled the scent of pines, mingled
with the marsh smell. The ground was steep and rocky. Logan’s breath
came in ragged gasps. He stumbled and dropped his light. The light
went out. He fumbled and found it, but it no longer worked. He cursed
the thing and stumbled up the hill, ripping through underbrush un-
til his clothes were in tatters. The threnodic cacophony of the

== fen_wer_18 66 ==

frogs beat upon his nerves with a sawing rhythm. He topped the rise
and staggeredoutinto the open moonlight. The bare hillside sloped
before himto the grim mire of the swamp. The air quivered with the
shrilling and booming of frogs.

  There was shadowy movement at the swampside. A large crowd of
shapes weaved in the elusive moonlight. Logan plunged ahead, panting.
His mind groped for the vague thread that connected this place,
these events, and the frogs.

  Moonlight glittered pale silver on the stagnant face of the swamp.
Dark hills stood round, soaking their cattailed feet in the mire.
Logan sobbed.

  "Linda!"

  Linda, dark hair shining in the light of the moon, stood naked,
thigh-deep, in the putrid water of the swamp. The Marshvillians
were clustered thick behind her, splashing in the cattails, shout-
ing - no, croaking abominably as she went slowly forward, arms up-
lifted, white skin like molten silver in the moonshine.

  "Linda!" Logan screamed again and tore madly down the slope.

  He ran, slipped, stumbled. The mire was about his knees, about
his thighs. Stinking mud splashed into his face. A hand clutched
at him, and he struck at the puffy face above with the dead flash-
light. The Marshvillian fell back, yammering frightfully.

  Then Linda was in his arms, pale, relaxed, mired with slime, and
the thing Logan saw he could never create again in the mind of him.
SOMETHING rose up out of the water - SOMETHING that bore vague re-
semblance to Uriah Marsh - SOMETHING that might have been him . . .
or might have fathered him. There was a fat, wide mouth, that yawned
in the moonglow, and dark things that came out of it, sprawling,
wriggling Things that explained, perhaps, why there were no chil-
dren in Marshville.

  Logan yelled then and struggled back the way he had come, forcing
his way through clusters of giant cattails, Linda relaxed and quiet
in his arms. Through the crowd of vocalizing Marshvillians he
splashed, beset with horror - for these were no longer human who
croaked and ululated, green-dappled and slimy, with webbed, waving
paws and bulging eyes and wide-open, croaking maws.

  Somehow Logan made it, back through the noise and din of frogs,
back through the moon-barred alleys of the pine forest and the shad-
owed village street; and because there was no place else to go, back
to the house of Uriah Marsh.

  There, gasping in bloody agony for breath, Logan laid Linda upon
a sofa where he could look at her in the shine of the lamp. He whis-
pered her name over and over and wiped futilely at the mire sliming her body.

  Linda stirred, opened her eyes, and smiled up at him.

  "I just had the most amazing dream, dear. I dreamed - I dreamed
I was queen over a great race of frogs!"

  Logan shuddered, dropped to his knees at her side.

  "It was just a dream, darling. Forget it! Forget it - please!"

  Linda's eyes were open wide and raptly staring - no, bulging!
Helpless with horror, Logan watched, heard her speak, and every word

== fen_wer_19 66 ==

on a lower, more rasping note.

  "I - was - queen - and - I - loved - it!"

  In the yellow lamplight, her skin took on an unholy sheen - dap-
pled green and white. She smiled. . .smiled - God, no! Her mouth...
Logan shrieked then - shrieked as only a man can in agony of soul
- and long and long he stayed there on his knees, shrieking help-
lessly, mindlessly, long and long after he heard the last, slith-
ering bump of the Thing that had been Linda, hopping grotesquely
out of the house to rejoin its worshipping subjects.


                             THE END
